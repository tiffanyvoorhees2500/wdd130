            <p>Hi!  My name is Tiffany Voorhees.  I am a mother to 4 wonderful boys, who keep me pretty busy.  This year, my baby went to all day kindergarten, and that left me with a bit of time to go back to school.  Before having kids, I worked as a software engineer, but I failed to make it through school to get my bachelor's degree.  Over the years I have had introductions to the following languages: HTML, JS(JavaScript), GAS(Google Apps Scripts), SQL, Java, C++, CSS, and just finished a block class and can add Python to the list. My goal with going back to school is to fill in the many gaps in my knowledge of computer programming.  I feel like I know enough to be dangerous, and my goal is to know enough to make it a side job and provide a little extra income for my family.</p>
